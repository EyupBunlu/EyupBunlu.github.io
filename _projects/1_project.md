This project was part of the GSoC (Google Summer of Code) 2023 program, organized by ML4Sci (Machine Learning for Science). The main goal was to develop quantum counterparts of some well-known classical machine learning architectures. These models were subsequently tested on high-energy physics datasets and benchmarked against their classical counterparts. Each contributor worked on a separate project that they independently spearheaded, while weekly discussions provided opportunities for brainstorming and accelerating the overall progress.

In the project I led, I developed a quantum-hybrid audio transformer and tested it on a synthetic electromagnetic shower classification dataset {% cite qc3 %}. This model achieved performance comparable to that of a classical vision transformer with a similar number of trainable parameters. Similarly, my colleagues demonstrated that quantum machine learning models can achieve performances comparable to their classical counterparts {% cite qc1 %}, {% cite qc2 %}, {% cite qc4 %}.
