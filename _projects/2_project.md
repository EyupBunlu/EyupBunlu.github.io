In this project, we developed a deep-learning algorithm to discover and identify the continuous symmetries of scalar functions in any given dataset {% cite sym1 %}. To enhance human interpretability, we introduced a specialized loss term that ensures the retrieved representation of the symmetry group is as sparse as possible {% cite sym3 %}. We further demonstrated that our method is applicable to functions with high-dimensional input spaces by leveraging autoencoders {% cite sym2 %}. Additionally, we showed that the method's performance can be significantly accelerated using Lie brackets {% cite sym4 %}, and that the identified symmetries can be factorized into well-known groups {% cite sym5 %}.
